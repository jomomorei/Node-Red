# Downloading Salesforce Data Into Excel/CSV File 

I happend accross Node-Red months ago. It's a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. 
The URL is here: https://nodered.org/

Last week, i tried to use it to connnect to salesforce and get the data by SQL. Then saved the data into Excel file and CSV files. A little pity, japanese can not be recognized in the CSV file.
